# ElementsOfProgrammingInterviews
This is a project that helps me and my friends to prepare programming interviews using the book, "Elements of Programming Interviews"

## For Whom
People who have multiple work projects, a hectic scheudle and little time to prepare.  

## Introduction
Let's try to be really focused and efficient about studying different problems. 

Language: 
- Python3

Books:
1. [Elements Of Programming Interviews Python Insiders](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Programming-Interviews-Python-Insiders/dp/1537713949/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_img_1?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=VBRYDAK8D3MC47K12V2Z)
2. [Introduction to Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844)

Key focus areas:
- Data Structures
- Algorithms
- System Design

Other Resources:
- [MIT Algorithm class](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/lecture-videos/)

## Chapter 4 Primitive Types

Chapter 1-3 are about non-technical parts of programming interviews, e.g. resume. We will skip these. 

### Key Concepts
- Booleans, integers and characters (in Python everything is an object)
- [Build-in types: numerics, sequences, mappings, etc](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html)
- [sys.maxsize](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.maxsize)
- [sys.float_info](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.float_info)
- [bit-wise operators](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bitwise-operations-on-integer-types)
- [XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or)


### Problems
Each link takes you directly to the code with comments
- [Count Bits](chapter4/count_bits.py)
