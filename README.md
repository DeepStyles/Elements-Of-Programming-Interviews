# ElementsOfProgrammingInterviews
This is a project that helps me and my friends to prepare programming interviews using the book, "Elements of Programming Interviews"

Update: As I started practising more and more questions, I realized that python is a great language however it is a high-level language. As someone who's usually more on the theoretical side, I decided to switch to Java which requires a bit more low-level thinking. Therefore, much of the code here will be continued in Java. 

## For Whom
People who have multiple work projects, a hectic scheudle and little time to prepare.  

## Introduction
Let's try to be really focused and efficient about studying different problems. 

Language: 
- Python3
- Java

Books:
1. [Elements Of Programming Interviews Python Insiders](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Programming-Interviews-Python-Insiders/dp/1537713949/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_img_1?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=VBRYDAK8D3MC47K12V2Z)
2. [Introduction to Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844)
3. [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1507572545&sr=8-1&keywords=cracking+the+coding+interviews)
4. [Introduction to Programming in Java](http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/home/) Note: This book has a lot of materials online, includes chapter and section summaries, and example code, etc. 

Key focus areas:
- Data Structures
- Algorithms
- System Design

Other Resources:
- [MIT Algorithm class](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/lecture-videos/)
- [Cracking the Coding Interview videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLX6IKgS15Ue02WDPRCmYKuZicQHit9kFt) This is speically useful for refreshing your memories on most of the algorithms.


## Chapter 4 Primitive Types

Chapter 1-3 are about non-technical parts of programming interviews, e.g. resume. We will skip these. 

### Key Concepts
- Booleans, integers and characters (in Python everything is an object)
- [Build-in types: numerics, sequences, mappings, etc](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html)
- [sys.maxsize](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.maxsize)
- [sys.float_info](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.float_info)
- [Python: bit-wise operators](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bitwise-operations-on-integer-types)
- [XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or)
- [Two's complement](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BitwiseOperators)
- [Java: Bitwise and Bit Shift Operators](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/op3.html)



### Problems
Each link takes you directly to the code with comments
- [Count Bits](chapter4/count_bits.py) in Python3
- [Number Complement](chapter4/476NumberComplement.java) from [Leetcode problem number 476](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-complement/description/)


*[Typo] At the bottom of page 23, it should be "-16>>2".*
